You can create external resources.

- The class should be `::Itamae::Plugin::Resource::FooBar`
- It can be used as `foo_bar` resource.
- Usually, resource class inherits `::Itamae::Resource::Base`.

You can see resource implementations in [lib/itamae/resource](https://github.com/itamae-kitchen/itamae/tree/master/lib/itamae/resource)
